while debugging shows colored and informational logs with log levels in xcode debug area

while on release logs the critical stuff you have to your google docs

you can ignore all other logs and show only the class you are debugging with just one line of code

its pretty easy to install ~2 minutes

you can easily tell the difference between system logs and your logs
